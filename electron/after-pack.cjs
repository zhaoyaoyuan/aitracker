/**
 * Re-sign the whole .app after electron-builder unpacks it.
 *
 * Why the identity matters beyond Gatekeeper: macOS TCC (the permission
 * database behind every "…would like to access files in your Documents folder"
 * dialog) does not store "this app is allowed". It stores a *code requirement*
 * that the running binary must still satisfy, and macOS derives that
 * requirement from the signature:
 *
 *   ad-hoc (`--sign -`) => designated => cdhash H"…"
 *   any certificate     => designated => identifier "com.aitracker.desktop"
 *                                       and certificate leaf = H"<cert>"
 *
 * The ad-hoc form pins the grant to the exact binary, so every rebuild looks
 * like a brand-new app and the user is asked again. The certificate form is
 * stable across rebuilds — and it does not have to be an Apple-issued
 * Developer ID: a self-signed Keychain certificate anchors the requirement just
 * as well, which is how yabai, skhd and AeroSpace ship. So the self-signed
 * identity is a first-class choice here, not a fallback.
 *
 * Hardened runtime: macOS 15 (Sequoia) refuses to launch an app whose
 * frameworks carry a different Team ID than the process, and Electron's
 * prebuilt frameworks are not signed by this project's identity. The
 * hardened-runtime flag (`--options runtime`) is therefore kept only when a
 * Developer ID certificate is available. electron-builder documents
 * `com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` as the way to keep
 * hardened runtime with a non-Developer-ID identity;
 * build/entitlements.mac.plist can adopt it if this project ever wants that,
 * but the ad-hoc/self-signed build is verified to launch without it.
 *
 * TCC-protected directories: the scanners no longer resolve project paths
 * inside Documents/Desktop/Downloads on disk (see
 * src/lib/local-usage/project-path.server.ts). macOS only asks when the user
 * picks or drops a file in one of them, which is the OS-mandated behavior for
 * any non-sandboxed app.
