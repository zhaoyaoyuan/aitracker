/**
 * Contract for every `format: "sqlite"` usage adapter (issue #42).
 *
 * The scanner queries a sqlite database through a prepared statement instead
 * of buffering the file, and bounds the result with a row budget
 * (`maxSqliteRows`). Two properties therefore have to hold in the definitions
 * themselves, and neither is visible from the TypeScript side:
 *
 * 1. The query must prepare against the schema it targets. `ORDER BY <alias>`
 *    only resolves when the alias is in scope, so a later edit can turn a
 *    working query into a hard SQL error.
 * 2. The query must return newest-first. The row budget keeps the newest rows
 *    of the whole source (P2-1), and the scanner abandons a database at the
 *    first row the budget cannot take: that is only safe while every later row
 *    of that read is older. Without the ordering the read would have to be
 *    consumed to the end for the same answer - and the same budget stop would
 *    silently drop the newer rows that followed it.
 *
 * ORDER BY is also what makes the budget expensive, and the cost cannot be
 * pushed elsewhere (P2-2, measured on a 5M-row fixture with a 365-day window):
 * the ordering is a computed timestamp expression, so no index can serve it -
 * with `sessions(ended_at)` indexed the plan is still `SCAN` + `USE TEMP
 * B-TREE FOR ORDER BY` - and a `LIMIT` pushdown makes the scan slower (10.2 s
 * against 7.0 s) rather than bounding the sort. The lever that does work is the
 * window filter asserted below, which keeps out-of-window rows out of the
 * sorter.
