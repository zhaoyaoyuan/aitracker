AITracker is an **open-source, local-first AI workspace**.

It automatically tracks tokens, costs, and usage trends across AI tools such as Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor; brings Skills and frequently used configurations into one place; distills Skills from real work and usage history; and builds a personal knowledge base and long-term memory. Every AI session can become a reusable capability for the next one.

## Why AITracker?

The number of AI tools keeps growing.

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Cline, Gemini CLI, OpenCode…

As the number of tools increases, so do the questions:

- How much AI am I actually using?
- Where are my tokens and money going?
- Which tool or model is the best fit for me?
- Where are all my Skills and other configurations scattered?
- Do I have to configure everything again whenever I switch AI tools?
- Can I reuse a method that worked today the next time I need it?
- Can AI remember my projects and long-term working experience?

**AITracker brings all of this together in one place.**

From understanding your AI usage, to managing AI capabilities, to distilling Skills and building lasting knowledge and memory, AITracker turns AI from a one-off tool into an evolving system of reusable capabilities.

## Quick Start

AITracker is a desktop application built with Electron, TanStack Start, React,
and TypeScript. Security scanning uses the published
`@estelwalks/agent-threat-scanner` npm package, so a fresh clone only needs the
root project dependencies.

### Requirements

- Node.js 24 or later
- npm 10 or later
- macOS or Windows for the complete desktop experience

```bash
git clone https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker.git
cd aitracker
npm ci
npm run dev:desktop
```

To run the browser development server only, use `npm run dev`.

### Install

You can download the installer of the latest release directly. These links stay
valid across releases and always resolve to the newest published one: installer
names carry no version, so the release tag is the only thing that changes.

- macOS (Apple Silicon):
  [AITracker-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest/download/AITracker-arm64.dmg)
- macOS (Intel):
  [AITracker-x64.dmg](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest/download/AITracker-x64.dmg)
- Windows (x64):
  [AITracker-Setup-x64.exe](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest/download/AITracker-Setup-x64.exe)
- Windows (ARM64):
  [AITracker-Setup-arm64.exe](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest/download/AITracker-Setup-arm64.exe)

Each release lists its own `release-metadata.json` and `checksums.txt`, which
record the exact version and SHA-256 of the files in that release. For a
byte-exact build, take the file from the release whose tag you need instead of
from `latest`.

All releases are listed on the
[Releases page](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest).

The following commands install the official stable release on macOS or
Windows. The package-manager entries become available after the stable release
and their corresponding distribution metadata have been published.

#### macOS Gatekeeper

The macOS installer is currently ad-hoc signed and not notarized. If macOS
shows “Apple cannot check it for malicious software” or says the app cannot be
opened, first verify the downloaded file against the release's `checksums.txt`,
then use one of these per-app methods:

1. In Finder, control-click `AITracker.app` and choose **Open**, then confirm
   **Open** in the dialog.
2. If macOS still blocks it, open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**,
   scroll to the security message for AITracker, click **Open Anyway**, and
   confirm with your password or Touch ID.
3. As an alternative, after dragging the app to `/Applications`, remove only
   this app's quarantine attribute in Terminal:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/AITracker.app
   open /Applications/AITracker.app
   ```

Do not disable Gatekeeper globally with `spctl --master-disable`. These steps
only allow the app you downloaded; if the checksum does not match, delete it
and download the installer again from the official
[Releases page](https://github.com/estelwalks/aitracker/releases/latest).

#### Homebrew (macOS)

Install and upgrade the stable Cask from the project's Tap:

```bash
brew tap estelwalks/aitracker
brew install --cask estelwalks/aitracker/aitracker
brew upgrade --cask estelwalks/aitracker/aitracker
```

#### WinGet (Windows)

Install and upgrade the stable package from the Microsoft Community Repository:

```powershell
winget install --id estelwalks.AITracker -e
winget upgrade --id estelwalks.AITracker -e
```

### Build and Test

```bash
npm run build:desktop       # Web app + Electron main/preload bundles
npm run typecheck           # App and Electron integration
npm run lint                # App lint rules
npm run test:all            # Unit, tooling, database, and scanner tests
npm run check:opensource-hygiene
```

Platform installers can be produced with `npm run dist:mac`,
`npm run dist:win:x64`, or `npm run dist:win:arm64`. Signing and notarization
credentials are not stored in this repository.

The standalone installer launcher is packaged as `aitracker` and supports
macOS arm64/x64 and Windows x64/arm64 (including Windows on ARM). Linux is not
supported by the launcher.

See [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the complete command matrix,
generated-file policy, and repository layout.

## Understand Your AI Usage

AITracker automatically collects usage data from AI coding tools on your computer and brings the scattered data together in one Dashboard.

You can view:

- Token usage
- Input / output / cache tokens
- Daily, weekly, and monthly costs
- Usage across different AI tools
- Usage across different models
- Project consumption
- Usage trends

No more guessing how much AI you use.

> **See how much you use, how much you spend, and which tool works best—all at a glance.**

---

## Manage Your AI Capabilities

What is becoming difficult to manage is not just the AI tools themselves, but also the configurations and capabilities scattered across them.

AITracker automatically discovers these configurations and provides a unified management entry point.

You no longer need to remember which directory contains a particular Skill, or reconfigure everything from scratch whenever you switch tools.

---

## Skills Distillation

A truly valuable Skill does not necessarily need to be written from scratch.

AITracker identifies experience worth reusing from your real work, historical sessions, and methods that have already worked, then gradually distills it into Skills.

![](docs/assets/en/02-skills-distillation.png)

Turn “I finally got it working this time” into “I can reuse this directly in the future.”

---

## Reuse Across Tools

A useful Skill should not belong only to Claude Code.

A configuration that works should not force you to start over when you switch to Codex, Cursor, or another tool.

AITracker aims to build a capability layer above different AI tools:

![](docs/assets/en/03-cross-tool-reuse.png)

Manage everything in one place, then continue using it across different AI tools.

---

## Knowledge Base and Long-Term Memory

AI generates a large volume of conversations every day, but only some of them are truly worth keeping.

For example:

- Important background about a project
- A method that has already been validated
- A troubleshooting process
- A useful prompt
- A Skill
- A Workflow
- An important technical decision

AITracker gradually turns this valuable information into a **knowledge base and long-term memory**.

![](docs/assets/en/04-knowledge-base-memory.png)

So AI no longer has to start from zero every time.

---

## Support for More AI Coding Tools

AITracker is designed for multiple AI tools and is gradually adapting to mainstream AI Coding Tools, including:

`Claude Code` · `Codex` · `Cursor` · `Cline` · `Gemini CLI` · `OpenCode` · ...

It currently covers **data collection and recognition scenarios for 36+ AI tools**, with more being added continuously.

---

## Local First

AITracker runs locally by default.

Your AI usage records, analytics data, Skills, Rules, knowledge, and memories are kept on your own computer whenever possible.

![](docs/assets/en/05-local-first.png)

**No account registration is required for the core features.**

Your data belongs to you.

Skills Market listings and exchange-rate data come from the project-operated
service `ai.trusttools.cn`; when that service is unreachable, the app falls
back to cached or built-in data instead.

---

## What Is AITracker Trying to Solve?

In the past, we were usually like this:

![](docs/assets/en/06-past-scattered-tools.png)

Now, it increasingly looks like this:

![](docs/assets/en/07-now-unified-platform.png)

AI tools are becoming more powerful—and more numerous.

But we lack a place that truly belongs to us, where we can **understand, manage, and accumulate these AI capabilities**.

That is what AITracker is trying to build.

> **Understand AI → Manage capabilities → Distill experience → Keep accumulating.**
